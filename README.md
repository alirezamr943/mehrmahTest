As you said we need to solve this problem with two other scenario 
    - n + 1 query 
    - sorting/orderBy (i added the depth param for this)

For testing this project project 
    - docker compose up
    - make some topics throuse store/topic api
    - use auto question creator to make questions for each topic
    - get the hierarcchical data through hierarcical/data/{id} api

there was two mistakes during the session first one was docker i fixed it
then it was about recursion and iteration instead of sending an array for recurssion i did iterate for sendig them for recurssion
